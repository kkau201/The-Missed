As a group, we have read through the National Curriculum, which is both the New Zealand and Te Marautanga o Aotearoa curriculum guide. The judging criteria have stated that we must create a curriculum resource appropriate for Year 7, 8, 9 and 10 students. Because of this, we decided to follow the achievement objectives Level 3 and 4. Along with this, as the topic is based on the battle of Passchendaele, we followed the curriculum guide for Social Studies.
<br>
<br>
We have decided to test our website at our school, Rotorua Girls’ High School, and our brother school, Rotorua Boys’ High School. We trialed Year 9 and Year 10 students for a week. We have also sent the link to Te Kura O te Koutu and asked their Year 7s and Year 8s for some feedback on the translated version of our website.

</li>

<h2>OUR ACTIONS:</h2>
<p>We utilised the key competencies from the National Curriculum as a foundation to create our activities.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Using language, symbols, text:
</h3>	
	<ul>
		<li>The whole website includes this.
		</li>
		<li>Both online and print-out quiz includes this.</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<h3> Managing Self:

</h3>	
	<ul>
		<li>At the end of our ‘Profiles’ page, each student can “lay a poppy” for Philip Gibbs, Hester Maclean, Stan Stanfield or any WWI soldier that they admire. </li>
<li>We have created our website to be as user-friendly, aesthetically pleasing and appropriate for Year 7 to 10 students and also for the teachers so they can use it as a resource material. This is so teachers can get the students to be constantly engaged and enjoy learning about the battle of Passchendaele.</li>
<li>Along with this, students can also utilise their other social media accounts to visit our other social platforms (facebook and instagram) as another way to share their thoughts on the topic and our website.</li>
<li>Teachers must guide the students through the entirety of the website first and observe if they are actually on the site (as students may get distracted and go on other sites).
</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
		<h3> Participating and Contributing:
</h3>	
	<ul>
		<li>Provide an overview of each page (such as causes, profiles and significance) and discuss it as a class. 

		</li>
		<li>Give a hand-out quiz to the class after going through and discussing the subject. The quiz is a recap of what the students should have learned through browsing our website. </li>
	</ul>	
	<br>
		<h3> Thinking:
</h3>	
	<ul>
		<li>Through the end of each page, the class can have a time to discuss their thoughts depending on the topic

		</li>
		<li>This is seen especially on the “Gallipoli and Passchendaele: Which one was worse?” page in which the students can decide amongst each other which battle they believed caused a greater disaster in New Zealand military history.
</li>
		<li>To conclude, the teacher can give a hand-out quiz (provided on the resource page) to all students who participated, which asks them questions about the battle of Passchendaele.
</li>
	</ul>
		<br>
		<h3> Relating to Others:
</h3>	
	<ul>
		<li>Lay a poppy to one or all of the people mentioned on our ‘Profiles’ page to acknowledge and commemorate their service during Battle of Passchendaele during WWI.

		</li>
		<li>Quizizz quiz (online quiz) for students to verse each other and test their knowledge on the Battle of Passchendaele</li>
<li>Hand-out quiz to print out to students at the end of their discussion/looking through the website
</li>
<li>Share their thoughts on propaganda posters, significance, consequences and profiles on any of our social media platforms.
</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
