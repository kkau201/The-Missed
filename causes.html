') ? 'One cause for New Zealand’s involvement in the battle of Passchendaele was the introduction of war. Pre-war military training was introduced in 1900 and was made compulsory in 1909 under the Defence Act. This meant the young boys of New Zealand were encouraged to view the war positively through junior and senior cadets. Cadets were introduced to prepare young boys for war and get them excited and well educated about it so when the time came, they would be willing to sign up. Many young cadets in secondary school rushed to enlist at the beckoning of war, as they believed that they could finally experience something that they had been preparing so long for. Over 8000 boys enrolled each year in the cadets between 1914 and 1918 which therefore produced 10,000 territorial soldiers each year. [1] ] https://nzhistory.govt.nz/war/children-and-first-world-war/cadet-trainingThis shows how conditioned the boys became to the idea of war while simultaneously reflecting the ‘war fever’ that was present throughout society. Alternatively, the government was in favour of this pre-war military training, because it ensured the availability of soldiers who were eager to volunteer if a war was to ever break out. New Zealanders were at the battle of Passchendaele for a multitude of reasons, many of which were the governments decision to make sure our country remained safe, secure and amongst Britain’s most favourable. As soon as Britain declared war on Germany, the New Zealand government jumped at the chance to volunteer their country and show Britain their support. New Zealand was part of the British Empire at the time, and relied heavily on them for safety, resources and commerce. New Zealand was and is a small nation, geographically isolated, yet, we are in perfect placing for an enemy to attack from the seas. If Britain were to be defeated during the war, New Zealand could become endangered to other countries larger than us and have no higher defence or protection. Not only this, but New Zealand could easily become a settlement/peace offering from Britain to an enemy as they were a British colony. Japan at the time was a large threat to New Zealand as they were rapidly evolving as a nation and it was a huge possibility for them or any other country to try and take NZ. New Zealand clearly did not have enough independence or defence to sit this war out and the government knew that. Britain was also New Zealand’s biggest trader and the country wanted to continue the healthy trading relationship to ensure that stability in New Zealand’s economy would be the same during and after the war. These reasons for our involvement in war were due to New Zealanders feeling vulnerable, meaning our country chose to enter war to protect ourselves. New Zealand wanted to show Britain the immense loyalty they had. A further cause of New Zealand’s involvement in the battle of Passchendaele that was obvious, was the public’s influence brought on by patriotism. New Zealand was so proud to be under Britains wing with many patriotic people even vocalising their love for their mother country.' : 'Ko tetahi o nga putake mo te whakaurutanga o Aotearoa ki te pakanga o Passchendaele ko te whakatuuwheratanga o nga pakanga.
