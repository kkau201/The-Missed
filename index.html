'The battle of Passchendaele is a significant event in New Zealand history. It was a campaign during World War 1 that began on July 31st, 1917 and ended on November 20th, 1917. The battle of Passchendaele was fought between the allies and the Germans from July 31st, 1917 to November 20th, 1917. The battle took place in the Belgian village of Passchendaele. The objective was to push the German defence lines back to not only capture Passchendaele but to put less pressure on the naval battle that was preventing shipping to Britain. It poured down with rain for most of the battle, which made the terrain muddy and slushy. Trenches were dug and soldiers were prepared for a defensive battle. At Passchendaele, New Zealand’s “blackest day” took place on the 12th of October 1917. The New Zealand and Australian divisions were to take the ridge of Passchendaele, however, that did not happen as things made a turn for the worst. The artillery barrage opened fire too short, resulting in them accidentally killing their own soldiers Alternatively if men did not find death from their own then they continued forward however most soldiers who tried to move forward were shot immediately by the Germans. Those who got near enough and made it to the barbed wire found that it had not been cut up by their guns properly and they could not move much further. Therefore, they too were taken down by the Germans. On this singular day, 800 soldiers and 45 officers died, along with over 2700 soldiers injured. Days prior, over 300 soldiers had died and before that there were even more casualties. It was not just New Zealanders who lost a lot of lives, the British Army and German Empire had similar losses. The Germans, two days after the “blackest day”, signalled for a truce to get the wounded and dead and few days after that, on the 18th of October, the allies were relieved by Canadian troops. This campaign was finished on the 10th of November 1917 by the Canadian Corps.' : 'He rahi te hiranga o te pakanga o Passchendaele ki a tatou o Aotearoa whanui.
