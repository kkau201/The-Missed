						<p>New Zealand nurses who served overseas during the First World War enlisted for the same reasons as the soldier's: duty, patriotism and adventure. They even went through many of the same dangers and annoyances faced by the men at war. But their war was different from the soldier’s. These mentioned annoyances included facing prejudice and sexism brought on by the fighting men. Although the nurses were supposed to be treated as officers, they often had to fight for the recognition of their rank. These ladies were also often paid less than the men fighting in battle and even the male orderlies they worked with. However the biggest problem for these females in battle was the fact that most lost lovers, fiancés, husbands and brothers in the fight.

Forty New Zealand nurses including Hester Maclean worked in the 1000-bed hospital at Wisques. The work was tiresome and tough. The hospital had an average shift of three hours off a day and a half-day's leave once every 10 days. These hours were also subjected to change if there was an influx of wounded men, then all leave would be cancelled. Wisques, situated in France, was one of the hospitals that treated New Zealanders wounded in Passchendaele during October 1917.
 
Maclean was a Australian born nurse, hospital matron and writer. She was educated at a private girls' school in Sydney, and enjoyed society life until her father's death in 1889 which encouraged her to seek a more satisfying occupation. Inspired by the example of her father's nurse, she began nursing training at Sydney's Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in 1890, qualifying in August 1893.

Then in 1915, because of Maclean’s efforts, the New Zealand Army Nursing Service had been established. She had been appointed matron in chief of a proposed military nursing reserve in 1911 and fought for the right of nurses to serve overseas as she was adamant that New Zealand soldiers who have been injured overseas should be nursed by their own. As head of the Army Nursing Service from 1915, she then personally selected and equipped all army nurses. The first group of 50 sailed to Egypt in April 1915 with Maclean as escort. Maclean also made a point to not only send future nurses off on their journeys but she also made sure to welcome them back when they arrived home. The group that first made its way to Egypt eventually travelled to England, where forty nurses then crossed to France in 1916 and in the following year they made their way to Belgium.
<br>
<br>
Maclean paved a path of medicine for not only women but people who wished to pursue medicine overseas. Her work in nursing has earned her recognition in the awards of the Royal Red Cross (first class) in 1917 and later on she was bestowed the Florence Nightingale Medal in 1920.
