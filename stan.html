						<p>Many men were unsure if the war would ever end and this idea was especially felt by New Zealand soldier Stan stanfield. Sidney George Stanfield or Stan was born in Tinui, near Masterton, in 1900. He worked as a farmhand before going to war in 1916 with the Wellington Infantry Battalion. Being a young man his perception of the war differed from that of his older comrades. However the idea of fatality was shared by all men fighting for their cause whether it be New Zealand or Germany.
 						<br>
 						<br>
						Stanfield recalls his time at the forefront of war in an interview by the NZ History Website stating, “‘You’re loaded down with 220 rounds of ammunition in your pouches, two bandoliers of 50s, one slung over each way, 48 hours’ rations, a full water bottle, a shovel or a pick shoved down your equipment at the back and a rifle and bayonet.” He continues by saying that time spent in the trenches brought more anxiety than fighting above ground, he contradicts the two situations saying that it was adrenalin that pulled him through the battle and extinguished the fear inside of him. He also attributes his time spent in pre-war military for his ability to withstand life in war.
 						<br>
 						<br>
						Stanfield eventually found himself as a stretcher-bearer during and after the “Blackest Day.” Every day that he worked bringing bodies back to safety he again and again faced the fragility of existence. At one instance he estimated having over 600 injured men lying in the wet and cold just waiting for the assistance of a doctor. This instance shows the reality of war and magnifies the conditions that Stanfield and others had to work through in order to survive.
