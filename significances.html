'Since the aftermath of the war, the Battle of Passchendaele gradually gained significance in the hearts of New Zealanders in the following years. Due to being known as not only one of the greatest military disasters in New Zealand history, it had also affected individuals around the globe. The nation continues to commemorate the great soldiers and other affected New Zealanders during that time. An example of this was on October 12, 2012, where a national commemorative service was held at the National War Memorial in Auckland and Tomb of the Unknown Warrior in Wellington to celebrate the 95th Anniversary of the Battle of Passchendaele.
