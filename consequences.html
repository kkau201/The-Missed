Engari e ai ki te wharangi NZ History “The offensive had long since failed in its strategic purpose and the capture of Passchendaele no longer represented any significant gain”[https://nzhistory.govt.nz/845-nz-soldiers-die-in-botched-attack-at-bellevue-spur-passchendaele-on-western-front] Na te koretaketanga o te whakahau i puta te ra pouri o Aotearoa “The blackest day”, a, i te mutunga ke mai i mohio etahi o nga hoia ko te take anake mo te maha o nga kaiwhawhai ki kora no konei ko te here atu ki Passchendaele ki te maataki i o ratou hoa e mate ana ki te mate hoki. ') ? 'New Zealand soldiers suffered many consequences during and after the battle of Passchendaele. The most obvious and prominent consequence was the large number of casualties. One single day at the battle at Passchendaele, the 12th of October 1917, is known today as “NZ’S blackest day” or “the greatest disaster in New Zealand’s modern history”. This is because a total of 800 soldiers and 45 officers were killed along with 2700 wounded in a span of 24 hours. Days prior, our country lost 320 New Zealanders. This is a considerable amount of people in such a short time. Another big consequence of the battle of Passchendaele is that the dead were not retrieved or buried for up to weeks, sometimes ever. Even the wounded were left to die many times throughout this battle due to time, conditions and supplies. In letters sent by Private Leonard Hart to his parents, he reveals the lack of attention the higher command had for the wounded and dead during the battle of Passchendaele. “During the night after we had relieved the Tommies prior to our attack on the ridge we were surprised to hear agonised cries of "stretcher bearer", "help", "For God’s sake come here" etc, coming from all sides of us…”[3] When he went to inspect where they were coming from, he found Tommies (British soldiers) all stuck in holes wounded, dead and “some insane” who had been there for “four days and nights” There were also many more holes filled with people in the same state and in another example Leonard gives, there were fifty dead Tommies in one hole. Not only were the dead soldiers not cared for enough, but even the wounded who could be saved weren’t a priority. It took a lot of men to pull one man from the mud so instead, some soldiers were simply forgotten and left. This is a huge concern and puts into perspective what the intentions of the commanders were. Perhaps they just wanted to do whatever it took to win the war, even if that meant thousands of men.  This makes it very significant because it was one main reason why so many men were killed in this battle. This is a significant consequence for NZ families at the time because some were not aware if their sons, brothers, dads, uncles or friends at Passchendaele were alive or not. This absence of information could have lasted for months in some cases, with the higher command not willing to find the wounded or deceased soldiers until it was suitable for them. This also had an impact on the soldiers at the time who were stuck in a hole, waiting for someone to save them while their friends are around them dying as well. For the soldiers who heard the cries, it would have had a significant impact as it revealed the conditions they were in, in terms of the unknown landscape being filled with soldiers and the commanders plan. This would have deeply affected them as they tried to do their job while their fellow soldiers were dying and they could not save them. Another consequence of the battle of Passchendaele is that it was so rushed and unplanned that in the end, it failed to take away the threat of German Submarines and instead resulted in thousands of unnecessary deaths. Some soldiers knew from the get-go that the Passchendaele campaign was hopeless. Sir Douglas Haig who planned the attack shows obvious signs of no intricate plan to ensure the soldiers would take the right actions to win this battle and to keep the Allies casualties at a minimum. The battle of Passchendaele is often recognised as a failure because despite winning the ridge, there were too many lives lost to make it a victory. Former Prime Minister David Lloyd George called it a “senseless campaign”. An example of how the plan went wrong would be on October 12th, 1917, New Zealander soldiers killed their own, by accident. Disorganisation was obviously present when the artillery barrage opened too short of the specified range and therefore opened into the group in front, killing many NZ men of their own. Confusion followed this action because the men did not know what to do after this happened and naturally everyone did different things. Some followed orders they heard, some stayed put and others went forward which meant the Germans gunned them down. This then resulted in the deaths of many NZ soldiers because the plan was of no use anymore causing chaos. In an interview with Stan Stanfield, a New Zealand soldier who served at Passchendaele, called the infantrymen “dumb beasts” and “gun fodder” including himself because that’s how they were treated. He says if they were not lacking they would not have been “thrown into that sort of warfare, because it was hopeless before you started. We all knew that”. [as cited in Tolerton, J. & Boyack, N. (1990) In the shadow of war. Penguin Books. Stan Stanfield] In an interview with Lieutenant Colonel Blyth, he says “there seemed to be no definite plan”, “no strategy or tactics” and that it was “futile”.[Tolerton, J. & Boyack, N. (1990) In the shadow of war. Penguin Books. Lawrence Blyth.] He places some of the blame on the higher command because they insisted to carry on with the campaign that was just “slaughter” he describes. This is a major consequence because not only did many soldiers die but, they died unnecessarily because of the failed plan. The whole campaign is known as a mass slaughter that could have been avoided through proper preparation and control. The number of casualties on October 12th 1917 could have been avoided if the plan of attack 3 days prior had not failed which resulted in mass casualties. New Zealand soldiers were relieved by Canadian troops who successfully took over and held the Passchendaele village they had been so long battling for however according to the NZ History website, “The offensive had long since failed in its strategic purpose and the capture of Passchendaele no longer represented any significant gain”. The costly campaign was a waste of human life and its outcome had no real significance for anyone. This was extremely significant for soldiers at the time as they essentially ended up in Passchendaele to only lose many friends over a failed strategic purpose. It was also significant to our society at the time and even now because we willingly sent so many of our men to a campaign that was bound to end in tragedy. From the failure of the campaign came New Zealand’s, “blackest day” which continues to have a significance in present day today as our country has not had that many losses since and we still recognise it for that reason.

'Effects of the battle continues to be felt today, a long-term consequence for New Zealand soldiers was shell shock. Shell shock is a horrible condition many men who went to war suffered with afterwards. It is caused by trauma they experienced during war and can result in many men not being able to walk, sleep, talk and many other physical and mental matters. Lieutenant Colonel Blyth, in an interview with Jane Tolerton and Nicholas Boyack, talks about his brother having shell shock. The effects on his brother were most likely also effects on other soldiers who came home with shell shock. These effects included not being able to stay within a confined space. This would have been brought on from being in the trenches surrounded by many men. Due to the shell shock, Lieutenant Colonel Blyth’s brother couldn’t get any relief and therefore turned to alcohol. There were shell shock treatments but this soldier still turned to alcohol as a lot of others would have also done. These after effects not only affected soldiers but found themselves amongst the worries of family members and the New Zealand society who had to care for these men. A debated consequence of the battle of Passchendaele on New Zealand soldiers is the alcoholism as talked about previously, this led to the generalised reputation that all soldiers were alcoholics. The soldiers had drink readily available for them while on service and many took this opportunity to relieve themselves of stress, nerves and anxiety. Some men at the front line even got taken away because of drink which has made people wonder if some battles could have gone differently, and perhaps better if this was not a factor. People used this to blame the soldiers for making the battle so long and unsuccessful. Being in the war brought on nightmares due to the horrors witnessed in battle this made some men rely on alcohol to forget. The defence department were reluctant in taking any responsibility for these soldiers, claiming that it was not a problem caused by the war and that “70% of the men had already been heavy drinkers”. For some men, this is true but for others they had no choice but to drink if they wanted to stay sane, therefore it was hard to take action and sort the men out. Since the government refused to provide any treatment for these soldiers, families and communities suffered. Whether that was mentally, emotionally or physically, it was a huge consequence of the battle of Passchendaele and war itself. Nobody will really know how many people suffered due to the post-war alcohol problems though. The coverage of the post-war alcoholism is scarce compared to other issues that went on. When the soldiers returned drunk, it helped spark the prohibition, the ban on alcohol, debate that was going on in New Zealand. At this point, many men relied on alcohol so the debate was very controversial. Veterans were deeply affected by their newfound bad reputation which was publicly exposed by the controversy throughout NZ. Many women were also affected because these returned men would sometimes turn violent after drinking, as a result of drink home life also became complicated with the introduction of problems such financial struggles and domestic issues.

New Zealand soldiers suffered many consequences during and after the battle of Passchendaele. The most obvious and prominent consequence was the large number of casualties. One single day at the battle at Passchendaele, the 12th of October 1917, is known today as “NZ’S blackest day” or “the greatest disaster in New Zealand’s modern history”. This is because a total of 800 soldiers and 45 officers were killed along with 2700 wounded in a span of 24 hours. Days prior, our country lost 320 New Zealanders. This is a considerable amount of people in such a short time.

Another big consequence of the battle of Passchendaele is that the dead were not retrieved or buried for up to weeks, sometimes ever. Even the wounded were left to die many times throughout this battle due to time, conditions and supplies. In letters sent by Private Leonard Hart to his parents, he reveals the lack of attention the higher command had for the wounded and dead during the battle of Passchendaele. “During the night after we had relieved the Tommies prior to our attack on the ridge we were surprised to hear agonised cries of ’stretcher bearer’, ‘help’, ‘For God’s sake come here’ etc, coming from all sides of us…”<a href="https://nzhistory.govt.nz/files/documents/passchendaele-letter-len-hart.pdf" target="_blank">[3]</a> When he went to inspect where they were coming from, he found Tommies (British soldiers) all stuck in holes wounded, dead and “some insane” who had been there for “four days and nights” There were also many more holes filled with people in the same state and in another example Leonard gives, there were fifty dead Tommies in one hole. Not only were the dead soldiers not cared for enough, but even the wounded who could be saved weren’t a priority. It took a lot of men to pull one man from the mud so instead, some soldiers were simply forgotten and left. This is a huge concern and puts into perspective what the intentions of the commanders were. Perhaps they just wanted to do whatever it took to win the war, even if that meant thousands of men.  This makes it very significant because it was one main reason why so many men were killed in this battle.

This is a significant consequence for NZ families at the time because some were not aware if their sons, brothers, dads, uncles or friends at Passchendaele were alive or not. This absence of information could have lasted for months in some cases, with the higher command not willing to find the wounded or deceased soldiers until it was suitable for them. This also had an impact on the soldiers at the time who were stuck in a hole, waiting for someone to save them while their friends are around them dying as well. For the soldiers who heard the cries, it would have had a significant impact as it revealed the conditions they were in, in terms of the unknown landscape being filled with soldiers and the commander's plan. This would have deeply affected them as they tried to do their job while their fellow soldiers were dying and they could not save them.

Another consequence of the battle of Passchendaele is that it was so rushed and unplanned that in the end, it failed to take away the threat of German Submarines and instead resulted in thousands of unnecessary deaths. Some soldiers knew from the get-go that the Passchendaele campaign was hopeless. Sir Douglas Haig who planned the attack shows obvious signs of no intricate plan to ensure the soldiers would take the right actions to win this battle and to keep the Allies casualties at a minimum. The battle of Passchendaele is often recognised as a failure because despite winning the ridge, there were too many lives lost to make it a victory. Former Prime Minister David Lloyd George called it a “senseless campaign”. An example of how the plan went wrong would be on October 12th, 1917, New Zealander soldiers killed their own, by accident. Disorganisation was obviously present when the artillery barrage opened too short of the specified range and therefore opened into the group in front, killing many NZ men of their own. Confusion followed this action because the men did not know what to do after this happened and naturally everyone did different things. Some followed orders they heard, some stayed put and others went forward which meant the Germans gunned them down. This then resulted in the deaths of many NZ soldiers because the plan was of no use anymore causing chaos. In an interview with Stan Stanfield, a New Zealand soldier who served at Passchendaele, called the infantrymen “dumb beasts” and “gun fodder” including himself because that’s how they were treated. He says if they were not lacking they would not have been “thrown into that sort of warfare, because it was hopeless before you started. We all knew that”. [as cited in Tolerton, J. & Boyack, N. (1990) In the shadow of war. Penguin Books. Stan Stanfield] In an interview with Lieutenant Colonel Blyth, he says “there seemed to be no definite plan”, “no strategy or tactics” and that it was “futile”.[Tolerton, J. & Boyack, N. (1990) In the shadow of war. Penguin Books. Lawrence Blyth.] He places some of the blame on the higher command because they insisted to carry on with the campaign that was just “slaughter” he describes. This is a major consequence because not only did many soldiers die but, they died unnecessarily because of the failed plan. The whole campaign is known as a mass slaughter that could have been avoided through proper preparation and control. The number of casualties on October 12th 1917 could have been avoided if the plan of attack 3 days prior had not failed which resulted in mass casualties. New Zealand soldiers were relieved by Canadian troops who successfully took over and held the Passchendaele village they had been so long battling for however according to the NZ History website, “The offensive had long since failed in its strategic purpose and the capture of Passchendaele no longer represented any significant gain”<a href="https://nzhistory.govt.nz/845-nz-soldiers-die-in-botched-attack-at-bellevue-spur-passchendaele-on-western-front">[2]</a>. The costly campaign was a waste of human life and its outcome had no real significance for anyone. This was extremely significant for soldiers at the time as they essentially ended up in Passchendaele to only lose many friends over a failed strategic purpose. It was also significant to our society at the time and even now because we willingly sent so many of our men to a campaign that was bound to end in tragedy. From the failure of the campaign came New Zealand’s, “blackest day” which continues to have a significance in present day today as our country has not had that many losses since and we still recognise it for that reason.  </p>

<h2 class="col span_2_of_2">LONG TERM CONSEQUENCES</h2>

<p id="text_2">Effects of the battle continues to be felt today, a long-term consequence for New Zealand soldiers was shell shock. Shell shock is a horrible condition many men who went to war suffered with afterwards. It is caused by trauma they experienced during war and can result in many men not being able to walk, sleep, talk and many other physical and mental matters. Lieutenant Colonel Blyth, in an interview with Jane Tolerton and Nicholas Boyack, talks about his brother having shell shock. The effects on his brother were most likely also effects on other soldiers who came home with shell shock. These effects included not being able to stay within a confined space. This would have been brought on from being in the trenches surrounded by many men. Due to the shell shock, Lieutenant Colonel Blyth’s brother couldn’t get any relief and therefore turned to alcohol. There were shell shock treatments but this soldier still turned to alcohol as a lot of others would have also done. These after effects not only affected soldiers but found themselves amongst the worries of family members and the New Zealand society who had to care for these men.

<br> 
A debated consequence of the battle of Passchendaele on New Zealand soldiers is the alcoholism as talked about previously, this led to the generalised reputation that all soldiers were alcoholics. The soldiers had drink readily available for them while on service and many took this opportunity to relieve themselves of stress, nerves and anxiety. Some men at the front line even got taken away because of drink which has made people wonder if some battles could have gone differently, and perhaps better if this was not a factor. People used this to blame the soldiers for making the battle so long and unsuccessful. Being in the war brought on nightmares due to the horrors witnessed in battle this made some men rely on alcohol to forget. The defence department were reluctant in taking any responsibility for these soldiers, claiming that it was not a problem caused by the war and that “70% of the men had already been heavy drinkers”. For some men, this is true but for others they had no choice but to drink if they wanted to stay sane, therefore it was hard to take action and sort the men out. Since the government refused to provide any treatment for these soldiers, families and communities suffered. Whether that was mentally, emotionally or physically, it was a huge consequence of the battle of Passchendaele and war itself. Nobody will really know how many people suffered due to the post-war alcohol problems though. The coverage of the post-war alcoholism is scarce compared to other issues that went on. When the soldiers returned drunk, it helped spark the prohibition, the ban on alcohol, debate that was going on in New Zealand. At this point, many men relied on alcohol so the debate was very controversial. Veterans were deeply affected by their newfound bad reputation which was publicly exposed by the controversy throughout NZ. Many women were also affected because these returned men would sometimes turn violent after drinking, as a result of drink home life also became complicated with the introduction of problems such financial struggles and domestic issues.
