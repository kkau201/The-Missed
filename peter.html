						<p>Coming from Ngati Mutunga, Peter Buck was of Maori and Pakeha descent. Peter had a passion for medicine and later for anthropology. Gaining his M.D Diploma from the University of Otago, Buck became one of the first Maori doctors in New Zealand. 
<br>
<br>
During World War One he greatly served his country and his people, in particular Maoris. As many Maori were reluctant to join the first world war due to a dark history with the British, Buck strongly encouraged them to join the war efforts. His personal journey in World War One saw him as a medical officer for the New Zealand Medical Corps, a soldier, major and second in command of the New Zealand Pioneer Battalion (Maori Battalion). Being a medical officer meant Buck saved the lives of many New Zealand soldiers who were injured during battle. 
<br>
<br>
As a Maori participating in the Europeans war, it was a different scene for them to be fighting alongside the British. Initially, Maori were not wanted by the government for war for a number of reasons; mainly their race. It was not until 1915 that the first Maori people went to fight in World War One. In 1917, great debate arose when conscription for Maori was proposed. Many Maori people were angry and frustrated because it was ‘not their war’. Waikato in particular resisted against joining the war very strongly.
<br>
<br>
Despite this, many people including Peter Buck believe that during World War One, the British and Europeans saw Maori as nothing less to them for once. In Buck’s diary he wrote “Just as the British troops had learned both to respect and admire their Maori opponents in the Maori war of 1862, so the British troops learnt both to respect and admire their Maori comrades in the Gallipoli Campaign of 1915. The Maoris had proved that for strength and endurance, dash and courage, they were the equals of the best troops in the British Empire.”
<br>
<br> 
Buck received many awards and medals for his service during war including a Distinguished Service Order award. He can be recognised as a significant individual that accomplished many great achievements as a Maori and a New Zealander.
